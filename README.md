# 🏗️ S.O.L.I.D. Principles

S.O.L.I.D is a set of five design principles that improve the maintainability, scalability, and readability of software systems. These principles help developers write cleaner and more flexible code.

## 📜 The Five Principles

### 1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**"A class should have only one reason to change."**

- Each class should do **one thing** and do it well.
- Helps in keeping the code **modular** and **easy to maintain**.

### 2️⃣ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."**

- New functionality should be added **without altering** existing code.
- Use **abstraction and inheritance** to extend behaviors.

### 3️⃣ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**"Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes."**

- A subclass should be able to replace its superclass **without breaking the application**.
- Ensures **robust inheritance** and avoids unexpected behavior.

### 4️⃣ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**"No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use."**

- Create **small, specific** interfaces rather than one large interface.
- Improves **flexibility** and **code organization**.

### 5️⃣ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**"Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations."**

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
- Use **interfaces or abstract classes** to reduce coupling.

## 🚀 Why Use S.O.L.I.D.?

✔️ Improves **code maintainability**
✔️ Enhances **scalability**
✔️ Makes debugging and testing **easier**
✔️ Promotes **better software architecture**

By following S.O.L.I.D principles, you create more **flexible**, **extensible**, and **robust** software systems. 🎯
